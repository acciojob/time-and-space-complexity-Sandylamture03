	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is essential to write efficient algorithms.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. For example, <b>Space Complexity</b> can be expressed as O(n).</p>
